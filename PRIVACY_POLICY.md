# Privacy Policy for Reddit LLM Comment Detector

**Last Updated:** June 2, 2025

## Overview

The Reddit LLM Comment Detector Chrome extension ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your information.

## Data Collection

**We collect NO personal data whatsoever.** Specifically:

- **No personal information** is collected, stored, or transmitted
- **No browsing history** is tracked or recorded
- **No user identifiers** are collected or stored
- **No analytics or telemetry** data is sent to external servers
- **No network requests** are made to external services by the extension

## Local Data Storage

The extension stores data locally on your device only for functionality purposes:

- **User preferences** (display settings, aggression levels, model selection)
- **Comment analysis results** (to avoid re-analyzing the same comments)
- **User scoring data** (locally calculated scores based on AI detection results)

All data is stored locally in your browser's storage and **never leaves your device**.

## Data Processing

- All AI comment detection is performed **locally** using downloaded machine learning models
- No comment text or analysis results are transmitted to external servers
- The extension operates entirely offline after the initial model download

## Data Export

The extension provides an optional data export feature that:
- Allows you to download your locally stored user scoring data as a CSV file
- **You control** what data is exported and where it goes
- No data is automatically sent anywhere

## Third-Party Services

The extension does **not** use any third-party analytics, tracking, or data collection services.

## Data Sharing

We **do not share, sell, or transmit** any data because we don't collect any data in the first place.

## Your Rights

- You can clear all locally stored data at any time using the "Clear Data" button in the extension
- You can uninstall the extension to remove all associated data
- You control all settings and data export functions

## Commitment to Privacy

We pledge to:
- **Never collect personal data** in future updates
- **Never introduce tracking or analytics** in future versions
- **Always operate locally** without external data transmission
- **Maintain transparency** about any changes to data handling

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever modify our data handling practices (which we do not plan to do), we will:
- Update this privacy policy with a new "Last Updated" date
- Clearly communicate any changes in extension update notes
- Ensure any changes maintain our commitment to user privacy
