# Reddit LLM Comment Detector

A browser extension that uses machine learning to detect AI-generated comments on Reddit. Built with [🤗 Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js) for client-side inference.

## 🎯 What It Does

This extension analyzes Reddit comments in real-time to identify content that may have been generated by Large Language Models (AI). It provides:

- **🚨 Visual highlighting** of potentially AI-generated comments
- **📊 User scoring system** that tracks AI detection percentages for individual users  
- **🎨 Color-coded risk levels** (green/orange/red based on AI percentage)
- **💾 Persistent tracking** across browsing sessions
- **⚡ Real-time analysis** as you browse Reddit
- **🎛️ Customizable aggression levels** from passive highlighting to auto-minimizing AI comments

## 🧠 How It Works

The extension uses specialized AI models trained to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text:

- **slop-detector-mini-2** (Recommended): Balanced performance with fewer false negatives
- **slop-detector-mini**: Fast and compact but more false positives  
- **slop-detector**: Larger model, slower and less accurate

All processing happens locally in your browser - no data is sent to external servers.

## 🚀 Installation

**Note: These extensions are not yet available on the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons store, but will be soon!**

## 📋 Features

### Comment Detection
- **Automatic scanning** of Reddit comments as you browse
- **Smart detection** using state-of-the-art NLP models
- **Confidence scoring** to reduce false positives

### User Tracking
- **Persistent scoring** system that remembers users across sessions
- **AI percentage tracking** showing what % of a user's comments were flagged as AI
- **Comment history** with confidence scores and timestamps

### Visual Indicators
- **Highlighted comments** with orange warning badges for AI-detected content
- **User badges** showing AI percentage next to usernames
- **Color coding**: Green (< 20% AI), Orange (20-40% AI), Red (> 40% AI)

### Customization Options
- **Progress widgets** to show analysis status
- **Aggression levels**: Low (highlight only) or High (auto-minimize AI comments)
- **Display toggles** for various visual elements
- **Model selection** between different detection models

## 🎛️ Settings

Access the extension popup to configure:

- **AI Model Selection**: Choose between different detection models
- **Display Options**: Toggle progress widgets, user scores, highlighting
- **Aggression Level**: 
  - Low: Just highlight and track
  - High: Auto-minimize suspected AI comments
- **Auto-analyze**: Automatically scan new comments as they load

### Key Components

- **Content Script** (`content.js`): Scans Reddit pages, extracts comments, manages UI updates
- **Background Script** (`background.js`): Loads and runs the AI models using Transformers.js
- **Popup Interface**: Settings and controls, includes live demo functionality

### Building from Source

1. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build for production: `npm run build`
3. For development with auto-rebuild: `npm run dev`

## 🎯 Accuracy & Performance

The extension uses models specifically trained on Reddit-style text to distinguish between human and AI-generated content. While no detection system is 100% accurate, these models have been optimized to minimize false positives while catching likely AI-generated text.

**Performance characteristics:**
- Processing happens locally (no data sent to servers)
- Models are cached after first load
- Minimal impact on browsing performance
- Works on both old and new Reddit interfaces

## 🛡️ Privacy

- **No data collection**: All processing happens locally in your browser
- **No external API calls**: Models run entirely client-side
- **Local storage only**: User scores and settings stored locally
- **No tracking**: Extension doesn't report back any usage data
